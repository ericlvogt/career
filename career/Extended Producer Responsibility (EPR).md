A policy implemented by the government to hold businesses reponsible for the end waste produced by products they create. The goal is to incentivise business to create products and packaging that produce as little waste as possible and is easily recycled or reused. A government body is responsible for ensuring the policy is enforced and there must be a system in place to verify producers are collecting the waste created.

Parts of this policy include:
- Requiring business to provide a pick up service to recover the waste from the products sold to consumers
- Adding requirements on how much recylced materials new products must be composed of
