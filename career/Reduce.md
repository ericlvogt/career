The idea of using and consuming less to lower your impact on the environment.

To me this method implies you are able to change consumers habbits while the market is constantly driving consumerism. I think this is a real challenge given people are typically unwilling to change and especially more unwilling to give up any part of their lives. I think substitution is the best approach, create products which are less impactful and utilize marketing, labels, etc. to make them more attractive than the more harmful alternative.
