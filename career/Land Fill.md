Land fills feel like a huge wasted opportunity. Products are eventually disposed of by humans and the product is either burned or just burried. Either releases large amount of greenhouse gases. Chemically it feels like burning trash makes it even more difficult to recover the original valuable product that was purchased in the first place. 

Thrown out waste from land fills can leak into the environment whether during transport or final storage [[Plastic Waste]]
